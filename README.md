### About
BigFoot is a student project for CS100 @ Cal Poly Humboldt. This is my iteration of the BigFoot game.

### Credits
The CS100 course was taught by **Dr. Ken Owens** at Cal Poly Humboldt. This included the code requirements which guided the projects. Dr. Owens is also responsible for the usic files (`.wav`) and background files (`.png`) which came from given course materials.

### Requirements
This program runs (rather annoyingly) in **MatLab Octave** (file extension .m). To edit files, it is recommended you navigate to the program folder using `cd .../bigFoot` in your terminal, then running `octave --gui`. This assumes, of course, that you have not only installed Octave but added it to PATH.

### To Run
To run this program, either run the Octave GUI or run Octave from your command line, then run the command `game`.

### To Play
You play as BigFoot, a red polygonal character trying to catch a meddling bat in his home forest. You are equipped with the ability to walk back and forth, climb trees and other obstacles, and jump. You can jump to the side from the trees or jump up from the ground. You can also rotate side to side, but this is rather ineffective.

#### ***Controls***
| Control | Action |
| :------- | :------ |
| `A` | strafe left |
| `D` | strafe right |
| `W` | walk up/climb |
| `S` | walk down/descend |
| `X` | jump |
| `Q` | rotate left |
| `E` | rotate right |
| `K` | quit game |
