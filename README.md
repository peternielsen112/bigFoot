# BIGFOOT: A CS100 PROJECT BY PETER NIELSEN
###### README last modified 10/6

---
### About
BigFoot is a student project for CS100 @ Cal Poly Humboldt. This is my iteration of the BigFoot game.

---
### Credits
The course was taught by Dr. Ken Owens @ Cal Poly Humboldt. The code was developed by me.

---
### Requirements
This program runs (rather annoyingly) in Octave (file extension .m). To edit files, it is recommended you navigate to the program folder using `cd .../bigFoot` in your terminal, then running `octave --gui`. This assumes, of course, that you have not only installed Octave but added it to PATH.

---
### To Run
To run this program, either run the Octave GUI or run Octave from your command line, then run the command `game`.
